        This page demonstrates a simple light and dark theme toggle using
        HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The button below listens for a click event
        using JavaScript. When the button is clicked, the script checks which
        theme is currently active by inspecting the class applied to the body
        element. Based on this condition, it removes the existing class and
        adds the opposite class using the classList property. The CSS file
        contains predefined styles for both light and dark modes, including
        background color and text color. Each time the theme changes, a message
        indicating the current mode is printed in the browser console. This
        approach avoids using any frameworks and relies only on basic
        conditional logic and class manipulation.
